Currently implemented using an XSLT script to generate Java source comprising the class and method declarations, suitable for running through [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/).

Includes a partial set of Java declarations of the framework of REALbasic so your source will be shown with the correct parent classes.

HTML output for a large project can be viewed [here](http://www.oofile.com.au/rb2doxysample/index.html).
